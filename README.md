# README

These files should help evaluating images for example from slide scanners using the software QuPath (Bankhead et al., 2017).

To use the scripts, create a project in QuPath and copy the scripts ending with "*.groovy" into the folder "scripts" within the QuPath folder. If the folder does not exist yet, it can be created manually. If a QuPath project already exists, the scripts can be copied into the existing "scripts" folder.

To run the scripts within QuPath, click on "Automate" > "Project scripts..." > click on the respective script.

The folder "classifiers" contains classifiers that were there by default and some that were added by me.
